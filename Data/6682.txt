Onion Bread I Recipe

Ingredients
1. 2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
2. ¾ cup warm water
3. 2 cups milk
4. 3 tablespoons white sugar
5. 2 ½ teaspoons salt
6. 3 tablespoons margarine
7. 6 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
8. 1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix

Steps
1. Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm. In a large bowl, stir together yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon sugar.  Set aside to proof.
2. Add milk, 2 2/3 tablespoons sugar, salt, butter or margarine, flour, and soup mix to the yeast in the bowl.  Combine until dough forms, and then turn out on a lightly floured surface.   Knead until dough is elastic.  Oil a large bowl.  Place the dough in the bowl, and turn several times to coat.  Cover the bowl with a damp cloth, and set aside in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.
3. Divide dough in half.  Shape into loaves, and place into two greased 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch bread pans.  Set aside to rise for 30 minutes.
4. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 minutes.  Loaf will sound hollow when done.
