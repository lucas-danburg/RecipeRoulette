Grandma Cornish&#x27;s Whole Wheat Potato Bread Recipe

Ingredients
1. 1 medium potato, peeled
2. 2 cups water
3. 1 teaspoon salt
4. ⅓ cup white sugar
5. ⅓ cup shortening
6. 1 tablespoon salt
7. 6 cups warm milk
8. 3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast
9. ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
10. 1 teaspoon white sugar
11. 15 cups whole wheat flour

Steps
1. Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/2 cup warm water.
2. Boil one medium peeled potato in 2 cups water with 1 teaspoon salt.  Mash the potato in a medium bowl, while reserving the water. Combine the mashed potato, potato water, 1/3 cup of sugar, shortening or oil, 1 tablespoon salt, and  milk in a large bowl.
3. Make sure the milk mixture is warm, and add the yeast.   Stir in 15 cups of whole wheat flour.
4. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead for about 10 minutes.  Place in greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface.  Cover with a damp cloth, and allow to rise until doubled.  Rising time will be about 1 1/2 hours.   Punch down, and knead again for 3 minutes.   Place back in bowl, and allow to rise again until doubled. The second rising period should be about 1 hour.  Punch down.  Form 4 loaves, and place into 9 x 5 inch greased bread pans.  Let dough rise again for 30 - 60 minutes.
5. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour.
