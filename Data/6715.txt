Canadian Doughnuts Recipe

Ingredients
1. 1 tablespoon white sugar
2. ½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
3. 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
4. ¼ cup vegetable oil
5. 2 ⅓ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
6. 1 teaspoon salt
7. 4 tablespoons white sugar
8. 4 cups all-purpose flour
9. 4 cups whole wheat flour
10. 1 tablespoon lemon juice
11. 3 tablespoons white sugar
12. 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Steps
1. Dissolve 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast in 1/2 cup warm water.  Set aside until creamy.
2. In a large bowl, mix together oil, 2-1/3 cups water, salt, and 4 tablespoons sugar.  Add yeast, and gradually mix in flour.  Place dough in a buttered bowl, and turn to coat.  Cover with a damp tea towel, and place in a warm place to rise for 1-1/2 hours.
3. Form dough into balls about the size of eggs, then roll flat to make ovals about 1/4 inch thick.
4. Heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep fryer, pot, or electric frying pan.  Fry doughnuts one at a time, until light brown on both sides.  Place on paper towels to drain.  Sprinkle with white sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice while still hot.
