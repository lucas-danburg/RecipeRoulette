Oatmeal Bread I Recipe

Ingredients
1. 1 cup rolled oats
2. ½ cup molasses
3. ⅓ cup vegetable oil
4. 1 teaspoon salt
5. 1 ½ cups boiling water
6. 2 tablespoons active dry yeast
7. ½ cup lukewarm water (100 degrees F/38 degrees C)
8. 1 cup whole wheat flour
9. 5 cups bread flour
10. 2 eggs

Steps
1. Combine oats, molasses, oil, salt and boiling water. Let cool to about 105 degrees F.
2. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water and let stand for 5 minutes or until creamy. Stir the yeast into oat mixture and mix well. Add whole wheat flour, 2 cups bread flour, and the eggs. Mix until well combined.
3. Stir in enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Turn dough out to a floured counter and knead for about 10 minutes. Place the dough in a well-greased bowl and cover with greased plastic wrap. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator overnight.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 3 regular loaf pans and 4 mini loaf pans.
5. Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and divide it into 4 pieces. Shape the dough into loaves and place them in the pans, seam-side down. Let rise until doubled, about 90 minutes. Bake in the preheated oven until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes.
