I have never made a github repo before so bare with me

DESCRIPTION:
This project is supposed to harvest recipes from www.allrecipes.com, interpret them, and use them to collect data in order to generate new recipes with an algorithm.

PLEASE NOTE:
A lot of the code in this repo is sloppy and all over the place. Some of it is even missing. However, all the data should be well structured. Looking through the data directories and files should give you a good idea of how recipes were interpreted, and how/what data was harvested (also the website code containing the algorithm is fully organized).
