Tomato Bread I Recipe

Ingredients
1. 1 cup tomato juice
2. 1 cup water
3. 1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast
4. ¼ cup vegetable oil
5. ⅓ cup honey
6. ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
7. ¼ cup chopped green onions
8. 2 cloves garlic
9. 1 carrot, shredded
10. 1 teaspoon salt
11. 6 cups bread flour

Steps
1. In a sauce pan, heat the tomato juice and water over a low heat until warm to the touch.  Pour into a large warmed bowl, and add yeast and honey; stir to dissolve yeast.  Allow to rest until yeast is creamy.
2. Mix in oil, parsley, onion, garlic, carrot, and salt.  Add 1 cup of the flour, and stir until smooth. Add more flour, until a firm dough is formed.  Knead five minutes on a lightly floured surface.  Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn to coat the surface completely.  Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
3. Punch down, and divide into halves.  Form two loaves, and put into greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pans.  Allow to rise for another 45 minutes, or until loaves have doubled in size.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (220 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, until golden brown.  Remove from pans to wire rack to cool.
