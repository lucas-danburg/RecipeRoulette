Grandma VanDoren&#x27;s White Bread Recipe

Ingredients
1. 3 cups warm water
2. 3 tablespoons active dry yeast
3. 3 teaspoons salt
4. 4 tablespoons vegetable oil
5. Â½ cup white sugar
6. 8 cups bread flour

Steps
1. In a large bowl, combine warm water, yeast, salt, oil, sugar, and 4 cups flour.  Mix thoroughly, and let sponge rise until doubled in size.
2. Gradually add about 4 cups flour, kneading until smooth.  Place dough in a greased bowl, and turn several times to coat.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rise until doubled.
3. Punch down the dough, let it rest a few minutes.  Divide dough into three equal parts.  Shape into loaves, and place in three 8 1/2 x 4 1/2 inch greased bread pans.  Let rise until almost doubled.
4. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 45 minutes. The loaves may need to be covered for the last few minutes with foil to prevent excess browning.
