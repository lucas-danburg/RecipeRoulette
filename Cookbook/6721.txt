Chocolate Bread Recipe

Ingredients
1. 1 tablespoon sunflower seed oil
2. 2 teaspoons salt
3. 1 ¾ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
4. 1 (.25 ounce) package instant yeast
5. 6 cups bread flour
6. 4 ½ tablespoons white sugar
7. ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder

Steps
1. Combine flour, salt, yeast, sugar, cocoa, sunflower oil, and water in a large bowl.  Stir everything with a wooden spoon until you have a soft dough.
2. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface.   Knead for five minutes, until smooth and elastic.
3. Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a ball.  Place both on a baking sheet.  Cut crisscross designs in the tops, and cover with a kitchen towel.  Let rise until double in size.
4. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 35 minutes.
