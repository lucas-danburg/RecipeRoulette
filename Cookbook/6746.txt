Nonfat Sour Cream Cake Bread Recipe

Ingredients
1. ¾ cup fat free sour cream
2. ½ teaspoon salt
3. 3 tablespoons light brown sugar
4. 2 egg whites
5. ½ cup skim milk
6. 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
7. 3 ¼ cups unbleached all-purpose flour
8. 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast

Steps
1. Combine sour cream, sugar, egg whites, milk, vanilla, salt, and yeast in medium bowl. Mix until smooth.
2. Pile the flour in a large flat pan and make a well in the center. Pour the sour cream mixture into the center and draw in the flour until a soft dough is formed. Gradually work in a little flour until the dough is pliant and soft but not sticky. Knead until smooth but add a minimum of flour to keep the dough from sticking.
3. Place in a pan and leave to rise until doubled in bulk. Beat down, knead briefly, then place in a lightly sprayed 9 inch bundt cake pan. Leave to rise until doubled in bulk.
4. Bake bread in a preheated 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) oven for 25 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until golden brown on top. If necessary, cover with foil to keep from darkening. Immediately remove from cake pan and place on rack to cool.
