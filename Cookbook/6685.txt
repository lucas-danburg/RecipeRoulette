Sunday Dinner Rolls Recipe

Ingredients
1. 1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast
2. ¼ cup warm water
3. 1 pinch white sugar
4. ½ cup white sugar
5. 2 eggs
6. 1 cup warm water
7. ½ cup vegetable oil
8. 1 teaspoon salt
9. 4 cups all-purpose flour

Steps
1. In a large bowl, stir yeast, 1/4 cup warm water, and a pinch of sugar.
2. In another bowl, beat eggs in 1 cup warm water; add oil and salt.  Mix egg mixture into yeast, and add sugar.  Gradually add flour. Cover with a damp cloth, and allow to stand at room temperature for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator and allow to rise overnight. This dough is rather sticky, and will raise to at least twice it's size.
3. Divide the dough into 4 equal parts.  Roll each section out into a circle on a floured board or wax paper.  Cut into pizza slice shapes, and roll slices large end to small end.  Place on greased flat baking pans, and allow to rise for 2 hours.
4. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 8 minutes.
