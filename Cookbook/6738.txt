Ingredients
1. 1 ⅓ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
2. 2 tablespoons margarine
3. 1 ½ tablespoons white sugar
4. ¾ teaspoon salt
5. 4 cups all-purpose flour
6. 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
7. 4 cups water
8. 1 ½ tablespoons baking soda
9. 2 tablespoons kosher salt

Steps
1. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water.  Proof for 5 minutes.
2. Mix in butter or margarine, flour, and salt.  Cut dough into short strips, roll into ropes, and shape into pretzels.  Cover, and let rise on a greased baking sheet for about 45 minutes.
3. In a cast iron or other nonaluminum pan, bring water and baking soda almost to a boil.  Gently lower pretzels into water for about 1 minute, turning once.  Do not let water come to a full boil.  Remove pretzels, and return to greased baking sheet.  Sprinkle with kosher salt.
4. Bake at 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) for about 12 minutes.
